Below is a guidline for how to use the code in this repo to build the model yourself as well as some starter code for analysis.
The methodology for **Tackle Probability** and **Tackle EPA** (**tEPA**) [can be found here](https://www.kaggle.com/danitreisman/tackle-probability-and-the-value-of-a-tackle#Analysis).

*Note: This repo is not complete. The code used to build to model is included in the [Kaggle notebook](https://www.kaggle.com/danitreisman/tackle-probability-and-the-value-of-a-tackle) [Follow me on Twitter](https://twitter.com/DaniTreisman) for updates.*
